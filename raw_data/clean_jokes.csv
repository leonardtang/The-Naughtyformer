At the end of their final song, there is a large cymbal crash, and the percussionists always miss it.  Angered, the director asks why.  ""There simply aren't enough percussionists to cover all of these parts.  No one can get to it in time.""  Frustrated, the director walks out of the hall and finds a homeless man.  He offers the man some money in return for playing this one cymbal crash at the end of the concert.  The homeless man agrees and follows the director back into the hall.  They run the tune one more time, and the homeless man does great!  Satisfied, the director lets everyone go home for the night.  

On the night of the concert, the director is anxiously directing his orchestra, and he gives the cue for the big cymbal crash at the end.  The homeless man misses it.  The director, who is now furious, rages through the orchestra and kills the man.  The police come and take the director to prison, and he is sentenced to death.

On his final night in prison, the guard asks the man what he wants as his last meal.  He replies, ""I would love 10,000 pounds of bananas.""  The guard, though puzzled, complies and brings him 10,000 pounds of bananas.

On the day of his execution, the man is lead to the electric chair.  After the first shock, he does not die.  After the second shock, he still doesn't die.  After the third shock, he still doesn't die!  So the guards release him.  The guard, puzzled by this asks the man if he knew something they didn't about having so many bananas in your system.  The man replies, ""No, I guess I'm just a bad conductor.""

I also like to milk jokes (drag them out a little longer than you would expect) so prepare for the cheese. There's a little flexibility in how you tell these jokes, and if you have any other jokes about jungle animals you can mix them in, but some of the order is very important (especially the first and las jokes).

Here is my preferred order:

Q. How do you put an elephant in the refrigerator?  
A. Open the door, put the elephant in, and close the door. 


Q. How do you put a tiger in the refrigerator?  
A. Open the door, take the elephant out, put the tiger in, and close the door. 


Q. Why did the monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. It was dead. 


Q. Why did a second monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. It was stapled to the first monkey. 


Q. Why did a third monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. It was taped to the second monkey. 


Q. Why did ANOTHER monkey fall out of the tree?  
A. Peer pressure. 


Q. What do an apple and an elephant have in common?  
A. They're both red... except for the elephant. (I like to say the first part, then wait a beat before the second part) 


Q. What's the difference between an elephant and a plum?  
A. Their color! 


Q. What did Tarzan say when he saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  
A. Look! Here come the elephants! 


Q. What did Jane say when she saw the elephants coming through the jungle?  
A. Look! Here come the plums. ... She's colorblind! 


Q. There's a big meeting in the jungle and all the animals come, except for one. Which one and why?  
A. The tiger! You left him in the refrigerator! 


One last note - you can mix it up if people guess an answer that's a little too close. So for the monkey joke, if somebody guesses tape or something stupid after the stapler comment, go deadpan and say ""No, peer pressure."" Just one example.

The next day, the librarian looks up once again to find the chicken handing back the second pile of books. 'Book! Book! Book!' says the chicken. The librarian shakes his head and hands him yet another pile of books. The chicken takes them and leaves.
Wondering what the chicken could possibly want so many books for, the librarian decides to follow the chicken home. Through the carpark, down several roads, and finally into a large park; the chicken disappears into a small grove of trees, and the librarian follows.
On the other side of the trees is a small pond. The chicken stops at the side of the pond, and there he hands the books to a frog.

He starts putting the pedal down as he gets out into the rural areas, just having a blast. His fuel starts running a bit low so he pulls into an old gas station. An older fellow wearing faded jeans and a blue shirt with the gas station logo comes over to the side of the car.

""What'll it be?"" he says, hooking his fingers into his suspenders.

""Premium, and fill 'er up,"" says the young man.

The gas station attendant, himself a petrol-head, admires the car and as he begins filling up the tank, he says ""This sure does look fast, but I'll bet ole Bessie's faster."" He jerks a thumb toward a bright blue Charger. ""I'll tell you what,"" he continues, ""I'll let you have this tank of gas on the house if you can beat me to the county line.""

The kid mulls the offer over a bit. ""A race? What if I lose?""

""You pay double the cost of the tank of gas. And tell you what, I'll even give you a head start. Soon as I finish pumping, you take off. First one to the county line wins, if you get there first, just keep going.""

""OK!"" The kid was excited at the prospect of not only getting to put his car through its paces, but getting a freebie out of the bargain as well.

The old fellow drew the nozzle out, replaced the gas cap and slapped the fuel cover closed. The kid floored it out of the gas station. At first he didn't see anything behind him because of the dust. But as the dust cleared, he saw this tiny blue dot way back in the distance in his rear view mirror. The tiny dot began growing and growing and rapidly blurred past him. It was unbeliveably quick. He squinted and looked forward and could see way off ahead of him a tiny blue dot. It began growing and growing and again blurred past him at amazing speed until it was a tiny dot in the rearview mirror again. Once more the blue blur overtook him, but the kid realized he was approaching the county line and began to hit the brakes. Incredibly as he came to a stop at the county line, he saw the older fellow from the gas station laying in the middle of the road just ahead. He was covered in dirt and cuts and bruises.

The kid was stunned. The old guy had beat him. ""That was amazing! But what happened to you? Where's your car?""

The old fellow stared up in horror at the kid, ""Car nothing! My suspenders got hooked to your bumper!""

I never asked why. Every time I started casting too many glances toward it, every time I started getting too near it, every time I mentioned it, they'd scream at me.

""Don't open the cellar door!""

For 12 years I didn't know why. For 12 years I didn't know what was there. But not long after my 12th birthday, my parents weren't around. They weren't in the kitchen. Not in their bedroom. Couldn't find them in living room. I walked to the cellar door. If they weren't anywhere else, they must be here. And if they're one the other side of the door, I'm going there too.

I reached for the doorknob. 12 years of warnings flowed through my mind as I turned and pulled.

These highly classified positions are extremely difficult to fill, requiring an extensive background check, training, and testing before candidates are even considered for the position. 

After reviewing several applicants and completing all the checks and training, the field was narrowed to the three most promising candidates. The day came for the final test, which would determine which of equally qualified candidates, would get the job.

The final candidates consisted of two men and one woman.

 The men administering the test took the first candidate, a man, down a corridor to a closed door and handed him a gun saying, ""We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances. Inside this room you will find your wife, seated in a chair. Take this gun and kill her."" The man, looking completely shocked said, ""You can't be serious! I could never kill my wife."" The CIA man said, ""Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job. Take your wife and go home.""

 They brought the next candidate in, the other man, and repeated the instructions. This man took the gun, walked into the room and closed the door. However, after five minutes of silence, the door opened and the man handed the CIA tester the gun, saying, ""I just couldn't do it. I couldn't kill my wife. I tried to pull the trigger but I just couldn't do it."" The CIA man said, ""Well, then, you're obviously not the man for the job. Take your wife and go home.""

Then they brought the woman down the corridor to the closed door, handed her a gun, and said, ""We must be completely assured that you will complete your assignments and follow instructions regardless of the circumstances. Inside this room you will find your husband, seated in a chair. Take this gun and kill him.""

 The woman took the gun, walked into the room, and before the door closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing. One shot after another, for thirteen shots, the noise continued. Then all hell broke loose. For the next several minutes, the men heard screaming, cursing, furniture crashing and banging on the walls; then suddenly, silence.

 The door opened slowly and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks! I had to beat him to death with the chair!""

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on his tractor and asked the lawyer what he was doing.

The lawyer responded, ""I shot a duck and it fell into this field, and now I'm going to retrieve it.""

The old farmer replied. ""This is my property, and your not coming over here.""

The indignant lawyer replied. ""I'm one of the best trial lawyers in the UK, and if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and take everything that you own.

The lawyer asked, ""What is the Scottish Three Kick Rule?""

The farmer replied, ""Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times, and so on, back and forth until someone gives up.""

The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom.

The old farmer slowly gets down from the tractor and walked up to the city fella. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy work boot into the lawyer's groin, which dropped him to his knees.

His second kick nearly ripped the nose off his face.

At first, the passengers do not react thinking that it must be some sort of practical joke. After a few minutes though, the engines start revving, and the airplane begins moving down the runway.  The passengers look at each other with some uneasiness.

They start whispering among themselves and look desperately to the stewardesses for reassurance.  Yet, the plane starts accelerating rapidly, and people begin panicking. Some passengers are praying, and as the plane gets closer and closer to the end of the runway, the voices are becoming more and more hysterical.  

When the plane has less than twenty feet of runway left, there is a sudden change in the pitch of the shouts as everyone screams at once.

 At the very last moment, the plane lifts off and is airborne.

The bar regular falls off his stool and laughs uncontrollably for around 30 minutes and as a result, is taken to the hospital.

A second man is curious at how funny this joke could be so he holds up a £10 note and the man whispers the joke in his ear. The man howls with laughter with tears streaming down his face and continues to laugh for 60 minutes. Eventually he is taken to hospital.

Old Gus at the corner of the bar is intrigued. No one has seen Old Gus laugh for over 30 years. No joke has ever been able to make him laugh, but he decides to throw £10 down anyway, just to hear it. The man comes over and whispers the joke to Old Gus. Old Gus then proceeds to slam the table whilst chortling like a hyena for 90 minutes. He is then eventually taken to hospital.

There is one man left at the bar, the bartender and the guy goes up to him and says, ""Want to hear my joke, it's the funniest joke ever made and I will tell you it for just £10, then I'm off.""

Eventually, he worked up the nerve to ask her out. The girl says yes, and the boy is over the moon. He's got to get everything ready first though. He needs a tux, to rent a limo, and to get her a corsage. The prom isn't far away, so the boy starts working on getting everything ready.

First he goes out to rent a tux, and when he gets there, there's a line at the tux shop. So he stands in the tux line, and finally gets up there to pick out the perfect tux. Next, a limo. So, he heads to the limo rental place in town, when he gets there, there's another line. So he stands in the limo line, and finally gets up there to rent a limo. All that's left is to get her a corsage, so he heads to the florist. When he gets there... wouldn't you know it, another line. So the boy stands in the florist line... finally he gets up to pick out the perfect corsage.

The big day finally arrives, and the boy gets ready. He's got his tux on, the corsage ready to go, and the limo standing by to pick them up. So, he goes to her place to pick her up, and she is stunningly beautiful. She loves the corsage, and can't wait to go to the prom. They ride off in the limo, talking and laughing on the way. They finally arrive at the prom, and ... can you believe it? There's a line to get in the prom. So they stand in the prom line, talking with their friends, having fun.

They finally make it in, and the music is going, the lights are flashing, and they start dancing and having a blast. A few dances in, the girl starts to look a little uncomfortable, and the boy asks what's wrong. The girl says, ""Not much, but I am a little thirsty. I'd love some punch.""

""I hope so,"" says the frog. ""The bigger banks have refused my loan application. See, I have a plan for a business, but not enough capital. So I could use a loan, to get things off the ground.""

Ms Black, being a kind soul, decides to help the frog. ""Well,"" she says, ""do you have any collateral?""

""Only this."" The frog opens up his bag and takes out a little porcelain figurine. ""It's an antique, rare Hummel that I inherited from my grandmother. I think it has some value.""

Patty looks at the figurine, and asks if she can show it to her manager. The frog agrees.

So she goes to her boss' office, holding the figurine. The boss looks up from his work and says, ""What do you need, Patricia?""

""Sorry My Son, but you can't take your wealth with you.""
""Please God, I have worked so long, and so hard, for so many years. I have lost my wife, my kids, my dog, my health, and my happiness because of it... It is all I have left.""
God understood and said. ""If it means that much to you, I will allow you one suitcase."" 
Overjoyed, the man gathered his largest suitcase and filled it to the brim with pure gold bars. He then placed it beside his bed and died in peace.
Soon afterward the man showed up at the Pearly Gates of Heaven and was greeted by St.Peter.
St. Peter was happy to see the man but was puzzled by the suitcase.
The Man said, ""I realize this is not your normal policy but I was given the authority by God that I may bring one suitcase with me.""

Confused, the townsfolk got out of bed and traced the sound to the nearby Tyne river, where they spotted something incredible - an enormous frog, possibly the largest ever, sitting on a huge lily pad. At first, the townsfolk wanted to get rid of the frog, as its loud croaking would soon drive everyone crazy. But since it was just so uncommonly large, they all agreed to keep it as a tourist attraction instead.

However, after a day of endless croaking and a sleepless night for all of Clara Vale, the town knew that they just had to get rid of it. Unfortunately though, every time someone attempted to capture the frog, it would hop into the water, only to return to its lily pad and resume its loud croaking not long after.

After many days of incessant croaking, a person decided to dive into the river and capture the frog that way; unfortunately the frog was just way too fast. However, just before the diver gave up, he noticed something sitting at the bottom of the river - a collar with an address tag on it!

The diver handed in the collar to the local police, and, after they inspected it, they knew that it must have been attached the frog. The police drove to the address on the collar's tag and knocked on the house door. A very ashamed-looking old man hobbled out.

""Sir."" said one of the policeman. ""We have been notified that the enormous frog that has become such a nuisance belongs to you. We found its collar in the river.""

The guilty old man, starting to cry, confessed.

""He escaped!"" the old man wailed. ""The frog on the Tyne is all mine, all mine! The frog on the Tyne is all mine!""",The Misplaced Frog,2016-08-20 05:34:05-04:00,34

I was one of their most valuable spies eight years running. But, the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger and I wanted to settle down. So, I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security work, mostly wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings there and was awarded a batch of medals. Had a wife, a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.""

A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.

Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it.

The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave.

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""

They approached Jim and his rancher buddies and made it clear that they were looking for a fight. Jim and his buddies were tough and grizzled from a lifetime of working outdoors on horseback.

The lawyer mulled this over for a moment and replied, ""First, did your research also show that my mother is dying after a long illness, and has medical bills that are several times her annual income?""
Embarrassed, the  rep mumbled, ""Um ... no.""

**Her:** Remember dad's tomato bushes? Well they're attacking! At least one is leaning across the path trying to get at my window... We had the war of the roses, now its time for the attack of the tomatoes!

**Me:** I don't remember anything about tomato bushes. From one battle to the next.

**Her:** Yep! Lookout tomatoes here comes the chutney recipe!

**Me:** I can just imagine a cucumber campaign. Operation onion would be next, which will fail, causing everyone to cry. Dill Day follows, a great success for the allied gardeners. All too soon though, the kamikaze carrots set in, utterly ruining the radish raid. The mushroom maneuver is employed, saving the troops, allowing them to deal the final blow in the asparagus assault!

**Her:** Don't forget the pumpkins want to supply ground cover with heavy support...

**Me:** Ah yes, the pumpkin paratroopers.

**Her:** Thyme is running out...

**Me:** Prepare the beetroot bombs!!!

**Her:** Aim for Potato Garden!

**Me:** Fire the capsicum! Deploy the celery team!

**Her:** Bring in the egg plant division to support the capsicum!

**Me:** This is it boys, life or dirt! I want a passionfruit unit to find us a vantage point, and the strawberry unit to surround them!

**Her:** We had better bring the lettuce up to date!

**Me:** The cabbage are under withering fire, we need support from the raspberry division! The potatoes are mashed, so well need to send the zucchini in their place!

**Her:** The zucchini can't take that heavy fire, they'll be grated. Send spinach for some extra iron. The sweet potatoes are digging in at the ridge.

**Me:** Prepare the watermelon bomb, we need to finish this! The eggplant were squashed, deploy the broccoli brigade! The beans need to get out of there, or they'll be split!

**Her:** Cauliflowers are going in to retrieve the beans. How brave to risk their florets!

The corn commandos are deployed, but the artichokes are all out of heart, we need to boost morale.

**Me:** The leeks are down! They'll be flattened if we don't do something!

Are the spinach still operational?

**Her:** Too bad the pepper isn't on our side, they're well seasoned troops.

Spinach is a go!  
Nothing has touched it...

**Me:** But wait! We still have the chillies to give them heavy fire!

**Her:** And the squashes and peas!

**Me:** The ginger is holding it's ground, but it's being cut down by the pineapple!

The basil should make things interesting, send them to aid the potatoes.

**Her:** The squashes might be able to pull a surprise attack if the peas act as a diversion.

Basil is sent, the energy tomatoe is moving forward, good thing the potatoes are there otherwise its attack of the Italian.

**Me:** The beans are all strung out, they need something to back them up!

Sending the raspberries to replace the peas!

**Her:** The turnips are pulling out to make room.

**Me:** The avocados seem to be remarkably tough, let's send them in!

**Her:** I'm all out of veggies!

**Me:** Gather the troops and retreat!

**Her:** The tomatoes have agreed to sign the Treaty of Vegi.

The rhubarb will preside over the treaty signing.

**Me:** Do we trust them to keep their end of the deal, or will they go soft under pressure?

**Her:**  The avocado's can keep an eye on them, their seeds are tough,.

They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.

Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.

It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.

Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper.",Watch for bears this holiday weekend,2017-06-29 18:51:39-04:00,10

And your baby brother, we'll call him the Future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense."" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. The little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father having sex with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, ""Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.""

They also found that is was possible to make a tasty but strong type of tea from the fur. For a while this was rather popular so they thought that perhaps an export business would bring in some much needed cash. Unfortunately the tea was not at all popular due to the presence of the fur which unlike normal tea leaves didn't fall to the bottom of the cup but remained suspended in the liquid...

His people believed a man's strength and courage came from his beard, and thus the man with the biggest beard was their chief. 

After leading the band for many years, Benny began to fell uncomfortable wearing the beard, in this hot and dusty land. 

He wanted to shave it off, so he called his council together to get their advice. 

When he said he wanted to shave, the councilmen were shocked. 

One said, ""Do you not remember the ancient legend, Sire. The leader who removes his beard is cursed and made into a piece of earthenware."" 

Benny had heard this legend, but being a modern man, he scoffed at the tale. 

Being headstrong, he went ahead and cut and scraped away his once magnificent beard. 

As the final whisker was cut off, a huge dust storm came up.

 It lasted only a few seconds and when it cleared, there was a man-sized clay vessel where only moments before had stood their leader.

Horse racing, poker, craps, you name it, our operation had it. It was a fairly large operation, as it had to be, and a few low life kids would always be brought on to do odd jobs. One was this baby face type of fellow, Ralph Spenson. The locals just called in Lil Ace cause' you could trust him to slip you a card if need be. 





Kid came from the gutters. Dad left early, mom was a former junkie. Not good stock. So of course the kid finds his way into this hell hole, and the visitors come to like to him. Kids seems a bit innocent in nature at first, but he develops a reputation as a bit of a cheat, but he's always forgiven an all on amount of his boyish disposition. 




Over time, he climes the ranks and becomes one of the low level bookies. The boys growing up to be a real snake of a man, but whata you expect with his background. So the world turns and the dice rolls.




One day, though, it's as if all of hell freezes over, cause the law comes walking through the door and a shoot erupts. 4 of our men our wounded, 1 cop is down. Horrible type of thing. No one knows how the feds found out. I mean, of course we know it's some rat, but we don't know who the brain dead sucker is. 





Men are sneaking out the back, police is swarming the place, the Big Honcho is in handcuffs. Fantasy I tells you. Pure and utter disbelief. This type of betrayal doesn't happen in our world. Not like this.



Then the bookie kid, Lil Ace, walks toward the police, and they shake his hands. Damn kid was an informant. He fit in with the crowd here so well, but he went straight on us. Dirty little cover up of an operation.

Make a joke before we croak, 
Give your funny bone a poke,
If someone yells give them a soak,
Go ahead make a joke...

Ok heres a joke to make you chuckle,
its a bumpy ride so use your buckle,
There once was a bull named Fumanshoo,
Fumanshoo ate grass until he grew, 
900lbs was Fumanshoo, 900lbs of perfect beef stew,

But Fuman had different plans in mind,
He knew the farmer wanted to eat his kind..

Day by day he made his plan,
no one was putting Fuman in the frying pan..

Fuman knew the farmer had a plane,
and if he could steal it he could fly to Spain and see his girl friend once again..

One day the farmer pissed off the rooster, 
an intense battle, but Fuman had a chance to seize his future,
He gave his fence bash and made his dash,
Shots rang out as the motor cranked,
But the plane was rolling to the cow gods he thanked,

Fuman knew what he had to do,
Fuman wanted to make farmer stew,
He pointed the plane and was headed for the farmer,
But deep down Fuman believed that there was karma,
So instead of Fuman turning the farmer into Farmer stew,
he simply ran the farmer into a big pile a Fuman poo...

Fuman flew and toward the sun,
Fuman was proud of the job that he'd done.",Fumanshoo the Bull - Funny poem,2018-05-16 01:02:24-04:00,3

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child.

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible.

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash.

He made it out, but a single person died.

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident.

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution.

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal.

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free.

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train.

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon.

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people.

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution.

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas.

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go.

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back.

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people.

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death.

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now.""

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal.

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed.

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...,2018-06-19 02:03:01-04:00,1

They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""","(Long joke, continues in body) Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.",2018-12-03 04:08:44-05:00,94

The Trids were an industrious people who traded with other towns outside of their little valley. One day, a giant appeared on the hilltops surrounding Trid. Every time a trade caravan would leave, the giant would kick them back down the hill. 
Over the days, the Trids began to grow afraid that they would starve without their bustling trade economy, so they held a town meeting to figure out what to do about the giant. They decided to try and reason with him before they would fight him, and that the wisest among them should go out the following day. Unanimously, they elected the town Rabbi as the wisest man. 
So the next day, the Rabbi went out to speak to the giant. He got kicked back down the hills before he could even say a word. He went up a second time with the same result. Although battered and bruised, he tried one last time. Before the giant could kick him he yelled out, ""Stop!"" And the giant actually stopped.
""What is it?"" the giant asked.
""I'm the local Rabbi and I represent the Trids"" the Rabbi replied. ""We want to you to stop kicking us down the hills or we'll starve. Will you stop kicking us?""
The giant looked down at him with a gleam in his eyes and a slight smile on his lips and said, ""Silly Rabbi, kicks are for Trids.""","Long one, sorry.",2019-02-07 22:54:40-05:00,15

t3_b3lcez,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/b3lcez/the_mailman/,"Courtesy of my science teacher who gives us a joke every day before class.

A kid, about 5 or 6 years old, woke up one night at 4 in the morning screaming. His mother rushed into the room to see what was wrong. He told her he dreamed that their cat died. The mother assured him the cat was fine and they both went back to sleep.

At about two o'clock in the afternoon the next day, the mother went outside to find their cat, which wasn't that old, dead.

The next early morning, the kid woke up screaming again, and the mother rushed in. He informed her he dreamed that their grandma died.

Almost like clockwork, the mother got a call at two o'clock that their grandma had a heart attack. She didn't make it over in time to say goodbye.

Once again, at 4 in the morning the kid woke up screaming. Same scenario, except this time the kid said, ""I had a dream daddy died."" 

At this point, the parents are scared, so they hatch a plan to make sure the dad didn't die. 

The next morning, the dad got up, ate breakfast, and went to work, being very careful and scared on the road. He made it to his office, and locked himself in. He waited a until midnight before coming home, exhausted but alive. They were both happy, but the dad asked, ""did anything happened while I was gone?""

The mother said, ""Yeah, didn't you hear? The mailman was delivering and got run over by a truck and died!""

In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York.

This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico. But as we know, the great ship did not make it to New York. The ship hit an iceberg and sank, and the cargo was forever lost.

The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery, were disconsolate at the loss. Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.

Every able lad within a few hundred miles wanted to play football for Central Catholic Fighting Knights.

Those who were familiar with the program, knew that the true heart and soul of the Knights football program was Sister Mary Margaret, an aged nun who would, in full habit, get out on the practice field and work on routes with the receivers, give pointers to the quarterbacks on their stances and releases, but most of all, love them like the second mother that she became to all of the boys in that program.

One year, on the eve of the state championship game, some evil malefactors broke into the convent and kidnapped Sister Mary Margaret. Everyone was stunned by the news, but none more so than the Knights of Central Catholic. They were devastated at the loss of their mentor.

As you might guess, the state championship game didn't go very well. For the first time in the history of the football program, the Knights were shut out. The Spartans beat them 42-0.

The fees for cars $1.40, for buses $7.

Then, one day, after 25 solid years of never missing a day of work, he just didn’t show up; so the zoo management called the city council and asked it to send them another parking agent.

The council did some research and replied that the parking lot was the zoo’s own responsibility. The zoo advised the council that the attendant was a city employee.

The city council responded that the lot attendant had never been on the city payroll.

Meanwhile, sitting in his villa somewhere on the coast of Spain or France or Italy is a man who’d apparently had a ticket machine installed completely on his own and then had simply begun to show up every day, commencing to collect and keep the parking fees, estimated at about $560 per day — for 25 years.

Assuming 7 days a week, this amounts to just over $7 million dollars ... and no one even knows his name.

“Something for this I have.” Yoda says. He reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape.

He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.

When they get back to Yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda’s garden.

“Something I have for this.” Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.

“That’s ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”

So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.

“Master Yoda!” he asks. “What did I do wrong?”

Yoda replies sagely, “A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!”","Yoda and Luke are walking through the swamp.

After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.

Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.

The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself.

But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife.

Until one day iron robot was silent and everyone was disoriented, not knowing when to get up, go eat or start a drill. Finally, I went to ask my commanding officer why there were no calls. He said “He’s taking a vacation day”.

It may sound like he's a bit nerdy, but we all have our things we love and he's a lover of old streets.

The ground of the alley is a light orange in hue, with a soft almost nutty sheen and texture.

His feet feel refreshed!

The street has gorgeous slopes and embankments, like an alleyway out of Florence in the 1500s, but made out of clay stones.

He sees two gentlemen working on fixing a small crack in the street, the only blemish for blocks.

One of them is pounding down the clay with a wide-head sledgehammer, thwap thwap!

The other is on his knees with a compass and a pick and a broom, adjusting the grade of the street material.

He interrupts them to say, ""Excuse me gentlemen! I hate to be a bother, but I just want to applaud your hard work on this alleyway. It's rare a city takes such good care with its streets and this one is one of the best.""

The man with the sledge stops and says, ""Well, we appreciate that sir. You know your streets, it seems! Would it surprise you to know that the composition of this street is not adobe? It's mulched with our native nut trees, the cashew nut. That's what gives it its softness. When it rains, the petrichor has a slight sweetness due to the cashew, and the town smells fantastic. I'm just hammering it down before it gets too cold.""

""Well, I'll be!"" cried the archaeologist. ""And what's that fellow up to?"" pointing to the man on his knees.

""Oh him! He's in charge of checking the grade of the clay. If it's too rough, he picks and sweeps it. Backbreaking work. We hire four of them, one for each season. And since autumn just arrived, he's got a few months yet. So you see...""

And here the man paused...

""So you see...my hammered alley is really 'cashews clay'. And he is the gradist.""

As if in answer to his cries for help, he sees in the distance a small tent with a long rope leading up into the air, and another small tent floating there very high above it. Surely, this second tent in the air must be a mirage, but the first one on the ground seems real enough. 

The man staggers up to the tent, trying not to think too hard about the second tent up in the air, or the odd pink rope that he can plainly see extending down into a small hole in the ground. 

When he gets close enough, he can see a withered old couple sitting next to a withered old cow with its face buried in the sand and rocks. 

The old couple, surprised to see a stranger this far out in the desert, hurry to help the man into the shade of the tent. Let's give him a glass of whey, they say in unison. 

The man, quite sure now that this tent at least is not a mirage, feels a sudden revulsion at the thought of drinking a glass of whey. 

Please, says the man, do you have any water?

Not much water in the desert, the old couple reply in unison. 

How do you live here with no water? the man asks. 

Well, you see, the couple explains, we have a long-tongued desert cow, she sticks her tongue way down underground to where there is water. We milk, her, but since she eats very little, the milk comes out as only whey. 

In response to this commentary, the cow flicks an ear and swats at an insect with her tail. 

I'm sorry, the man says, but I'm afraid I might throw up if I try to drink a glass of whey. I don't mean to snub your generosity. Don't you have anything else I could drink? Or is there a well nearby?

The only other person for many miles is our neighbors in the tent floating above ours. The strange couple say in unison. 

The man looks up, finally acknowledging the tent floating in the air. 

You can see their long-tongued desert cow's tongue reaching down into that hole in the ground right there. They live off nothing but whey as well. 

Feeling delirious from exposure, the man asks one more time... So there's nothing else to drink?

If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy but if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.

The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever.

The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.

The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won.

""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said.

""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.""

""And then what?"" asked a woman.

""Who knows!!"" said the Rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!""","Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy.

He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.

When they get back to Yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda’s garden.

“Something I have for this.” Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.

“That’s ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”

So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.

“Master Yoda!” he asks. “What did I do wrong?”

Yoda replies sagely, “A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!”","Yoda and Luke are walking through the swamp.

The minister gave a lesson entitled, 'If you could bring a suitcase to heaven'. The old man misunderstands the lesson, however, and actually believes that he is allowed to bring one suitcase to heaven with him upon his death.

The next day, he liquidates some assets and buys a few gold bars to put in a suitcase. He figures, 'I don't know what currency they use in heaven, but surely gold is a good standard for anywhere.'

That night, the old man dies in his sleep and, miraculously, his suitcase of gold bars is with him! An angel meets him at the pearly gates to show him around. First, he takes him to his new heavenly mansion to help him unpack before the rest of the tour. They get inside, open the suitcase, and suddenly, the angel gets a quizzical look.

""Hi there,"" slurs the stranger. ""Can you give me a push?"" 

""No, get lost. It's half past three. I was in bed,"" says the man and slams the door. 

He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says, ""Dave, that wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the baby sitter and you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? What would have happened if he'd told us to get lost?"" 

""But the guy was drunk,"" says the husband. 

""It doesn't matter,"" says the wife. ""He needs our help and it would be the Christian thing to help him."" 

So the husband gets out of bed again, gets dressed, and goes downstairs. He opens the door, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere shouts, ""Hey, do you still want a push??"" 

He hears a voice cry out, ""Yeah please.""

 So, still being unable to see the stranger he shouts, ""Where are you?"" 

And the stranger replies, ""I'm over here, on the swing set.""

Each time he'd stop the bicycle and open the sacks, and he'd find only sand. He had the sand analyzed at the lab and looked at the sack under a microscope he could never find anything wrong. This went on every day for the next month. 

After the officer retired, he ran into the bicyclist in a restaurant in Tijuana. After some small talk he said, ""Come on. I know you were smuggling something all that time. I won't tell. I'm just curious. What was it?"" The other man said, ""Bicycles.""",The Smuggler,2020-09-13 13:36:54-04:00,4

John tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to ‘clean up’ the bird’s vocabulary. 

One day John snaped and yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even *more* rude. John, in a fit of rage grabbed the bird and closed him in the freezer.

For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. 

Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. 

The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said “I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”

John was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird spoke-up, very softly, “May I ask what the turkey did?

A couple minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, with the dog to blame, she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer rip.

The father again looked at the dog and yelled, ""Darn it Ginger!""

Once again the woman smiled, grateful for the old dog.

One day, the magician has had it with the parrot’s shenanigans, so when the bird squawks up during one of his shows, the magician pulls out a gun and attempts to shoot the parrot. He misses, ends up hitting a gas line, then the entire cruise ship explodes into a thousand pieces. In the aftermath, two unconscious survivors are floating on some driftwood, the magician and the parrot.

But they still had each other. With both their savings near gone, and the business’s credit in decline, they knew a bank loan would be a long shot. But it was the only way they could save their business.

With great sorrows, they mustered up the confidence to go to their small local bank. When they got to the teller, to show some personality, Harry, like always, said “Hello, I’m Harry, and this Arab Harry.”

He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.

When they get back to Yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda’s garden.

“Something I have for this.” Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.

“That’s ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”

So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.

“Master Yoda!” he asks. “What did I do wrong?”

Yoda replies sagely, “A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!”","Yoda and Luke are walking through the swamp.

Flattered, the man responds, ""Sure... but what makes you so certain you and I would get along so well?""

""Well..."" the woman says. ""A couple things, actually. I noticed you were wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Iron Maiden are my favorite band of all time. When they went on their reunion tour in 1999, my parents took me to see them in Cleveland. I was 12 years old and it was the first concert I ever went to. I absolutely love Iron Maiden.""

The man can't believe it.

""I saw them play Cleveland in '99! First concert I ever went to on my own. My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavilion!""

Naturally, they're both shocked.

""If that isn't weird enough..."" says the woman. ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author.""

Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain.""

They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven.

""Ok..."" the woman says. ""Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favorite fruit!

It was a sunny day, there were many people walking past the two beggars. Everyone was giving money to the man with the cross around his neck money, while the man with the star of David got nothing.

One morning a high priest walked by the beggars and said to the beggar with the Star of David,

“My friend, you are in Vatican City and all these people that pass you by will give to the man with the cross, they will never give money to a man with a Star of David, in fact, they will give to the man with the cross just to spite you…”

The beggar with the Star of David turned the beggar with the cross and said,

“Hey, Moshe, this schmuck is trying to teach the Smith brothers about marketing”

t3_li29m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/li29m5/a_man_went_to_school_to_be_an_engineer/,"But after 4 years and lots of hard work, he discovered he couldn't find a job in his field. Deeply in debt, he took on a job at a mortuary. He liked the work alright, but was annoyed by how tedious and inefficient the place was.

The week after he started, there was a terrible accident. There was an explosion at a propane storage facility and several of the victims were dismembered in the blast. The funeral home was swamped with work and his boss told him ""Look, I know you're not fully trained yet but we really need your help so just do the best you can.""

He thought to himself, ""Finally, a chance to show the boss how efficiently I can work and how much better his business could be run!""

Being the low man on the totem pole, he was given the task of finding the correct body parts and placing them together. This was very difficult and was taking him quite a while to accomplish, so he came up with a solution to get it done on his own more efficient schedule. He grouped the body parts of one type all together. All the heads in one place, all the arms in another, and all the legs in another, and he cleaned and dressed them up assembly line style one type of limb at a time and then placed them in their respective coffins.

Later, at the group funeral service, the widow of one of the victims was inconsolable and said that she just had to see her husband's face one more time. The manager of the funeral home was sympathetic and opened the coffin for her to get one last glimpse. What she saw, however, horrified her; for in place of her husband's face there was an ugly swollen foot sticking out of the top of the coffin. Naturally this created a great scandal and damaged the reputation of the mortuary. 

When the manager pulled the engineer into the office to talk to him he shouted ""Tell me why I shouldn't fire you right now!""

The man replied, ""it won't happen again! I've learned my lesson, honestly!""

""I saw them play Cleveland in '99! First concert I ever went to on my own. My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavillion!""

Naturally, they're both shocked.

""If that isn't weird enough..."" says the woman. ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author.""

Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain.""

They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven.

""Ok..."" the woman says. ""Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees.

After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.

Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.

The warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself.

But he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife.

So he called Andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him.

But, alas, Andy refused.

He told the warden, ""Gosh, I'd really like to help you but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place.""","Several years ago, Andy was sentenced to prison.

t3_nfbrdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/nfbrdq/medieval_math_problem/,"There’s a far-off place that consists of a perfectly triangular lake surrounded by land, with three kingdoms on the three sides of the lake: 

1. The first kingdom is rich and powerful — filled with wealthy, prosperous people. 
2. the second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power, too. 
3. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, since it’s a valuable resource to own outright. 

* The 1st kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armor and each with their own personal squire. 
* The 2nd kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armor and a few dozen squires of their own. 
* The 3rd kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.

The night before the big battle:

* The knights in the 1st kingdom drink and are merry, partying into the late hours of the night. 
* The knights in the 2nd kingdom aren’t as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink into the late hours of the night.
* In the 3rd camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. he fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.

The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hung over and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up. 

In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. the battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing — ***the squire from the 3rd kingdom.***

And the moral of the story is:

So, she walks over and takes a seat next to him on the bench, turns to him and says, ""Sorry to bother you. I know this may be a little forward but I would love to grab coffee with you some time.""

Flattered, the man responds, ""Sure... but what makes you so certain you and I would get along so well?""

""Well..."" the woman says. ""A couple things, actually. I noticed you were wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Iron Maiden are my favorite band of all time. When they went on their reunion tour in 1999, my parents took me to see them in Cleveland. I was 12 years old and it was the first concert I ever went to. I absolutely love Iron Maiden.""

The man can't believe it.

""I saw them play Cleveland in '99! First concert I ever went to on my own. My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavillion!""

Naturally, they're both shocked.

""If that isn't weird enough..."" says the woman. ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author.""

Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain.""

They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven.

""Ok..."" the woman says. ""Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favorite fruit! I love prunes, you're eating a prune, this has got to be fate. What do you say?""

there was another man, standing out in the summer Texas sun with a mallet, hitting something on a stump.

Strong, tall, courageous, he was the ideal viking in every way, except for one.. See Benny couldn't grow a beard, for all his 30 winters on Earth, he still had just as smooth a face as the day he was born. This bothered Benny, because when he was out pillaging, nobody took him serious.. Who is scared of a baby faced warrior that looks like he's 16? The final straw for Benny just happened at the last raid his opponent laughed at him and asked the Vikings to send him a man instead of a boy. Well Benny might have slain that warrior for his crass comment, but his confidence was beginning to fade. So that night, during the rioting, looting and pillaging, Benny got very, very drunk on mead and wandered out into a field. ""ODIN!"" he yelled - ""Why have you forsaken me? I've been a loyal follower, I've fought in many battles in your name.. Why have you cursed me with this face?"" It may have been a trick of the light or the many horns of mead Benny had drunk, but Benny was surprised to hear an answer back.. ""Benny! I have not forsaken you, why do you say such things?"" ""Odin, how can I be a feared warrior when I cannot grow a beard? My opponents laugh at me and call me a child! I just wish to grow a beard like yours, one such that all will know me to be a man!"" ""Very well"" Odin replied ""as you've been a good Viking, I will help you grow your beard... BUT!!!! If you ever cut or shave, I will turn you into an urn!"" ""Odin, I would never do that"" Benny replied ""All I've wanted my life is to serve you and look like a man!"" ""So be it"" Odin ""but you have been warned.."" Benny passed out into a drunken sleep to awake the next morning.. When he awoke, he thought it all a dream.. until he rubbed his face and where once was smooth skin like a babies bottom was now.. Stubble? ""Yes Odin! Thank you! I will not forget our deal!"" By the end of the day, Benny had a respectable shadow on his face.. At the end of the week, Benny's beard had come in.. At the end of two weeks, Benny's beard had continued to grow and was now down to his chest.. His life was good, he had the respect of his fellow Vikings, his opponents feared him, and Benny had never been happier.. However, his beard continued to grow at an astonishing rate.. At the end of the third week, it had grown to his waist. His fellow Vikings were muttering about black magic behind his back.. At the end of the month, it was down to his knees, and in order to go into battle, he had to tie it around himself like a belt. At the end of two months, he could no longer move without the a\*\*istance of a wheel barrow to carry his beard in front of him, he could not go into battle, and he his fellow Vikings were sure he was cursed.. Benny was despondent. He began to think to himself about how busy Odin must be.. How Odin couldn't possibly remember the agreement they had.. How Odin must have forgotten him, for how else would his beard have continued to grow so much.. Benny couldn't take it anymore.. He took his belt knife, grabbed his long beard and just as soon as his blade parted the first hair on his face... \*\*POOF!\*\* Benny was turned into an urn..

“Something for this I have.” Yoda says. He reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape.

He tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.

When they get back to Yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around Yoda’s garden.

“Something I have for this.” Yoda says again. Once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.

“That’s ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”

So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.

“Master Yoda!” he asks. “What did I do wrong?”

Yoda replies sagely, “A Jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. Never for a tack!”","Yoda and Luke are walking through the swamp.

t3_ohzyn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/ohzyn9/how_the_internet_started_according_to_the_bible/," In ancient Israel, it came to pass that a trader by the name of Abraham Com did take unto himself a healthy young wife by the name of Dorothy. And Dot Com was a comely woman, large of breast, broad of shoulder and long of leg. Indeed, she was often called Amazon Dot Com. And she said unto Abraham, her husband, ""Why dost thou travel so far from town to town with thy goods when thou canst trade without ever leaving thy tent?"" And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, ""How, dear?"" And Dot replied, ""I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale, and they will reply telling you who hath the best price. The sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah's Pony Stable (UPS)."" Abraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. And the drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever having to move from his tent. To prevent neighboring countries from overhearing what the drums were saying, Dot devised a system that only she and the drummers knew. It was known as Must Send Drum Over Sound (MSDOS), and she also developed a language to transmit ideas and pictures - Hebrew to the People (HTTP). And the young men did take to Dot Com's trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Sybarites, or NERDS. And lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums that no one noticed that the real riches were going to that enterprising drum dealer, Brother William of Gates, who bought off every drum maker in the land. Indeed he did insist on drums to be made that would work only with Brother Gates' drum heads and drumsticks. And Dot did say, ""Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others."" And Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or eBay as it came to be known. He said, ""We need a name that reflects what we are."" And Dot replied, ""Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators."" ""YAHOO,"" said Abraham. And because it was Dot's idea, they named it YAHOO Dot Com. Abraham's cousin, Joshua, being the young Gregarious Energetic Educated Kid (GEEK) that he was, soon started using Dot's drums to locate things around the countryside. It soon became known as God's Own Official Guide to Locating Everything (GOOGLE). That is how it all began. And that's the truth.","How the Internet Started, According to the Bible",2021-07-11 03:20:43-04:00,1

Yoda and Luke return to Yoda’s home, where Yoda looks through his bag. He’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.

“That’s ok Master."" Luke says, wanting to be helpful. “I’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”

So he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.

He looks down at Yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.

“Master Yoda!” he asks. “What did I do wrong?”

But one morning, Clancy Chicken was making his rounds and noticed that a few hens had wandered to the other side of the pasture, some time before daybreak.  As he hastened over to help, he discovered that they were shivering uncontrollably in the brisk morning air.   In desperation, they had moved up alongside some cows that were queued for milking, seeking some relief from the bovines' body warmth. 

At first, the cows didn't notice.  But a few began to bustle about, annoyed by the intrusion.  Carl the Cow took notice of the mounting tension, scrambling to take control of the situation before things got ugly.   ""Ya know Clancy, ya really should keep a closer eye on yer coop!""

""Jeeez. That is REALLY deep... here.. throw one of these great big rocks down there. Those should make a noise."" 

They pick up a couple football-sized rocks and toss them into the hole and wait... and wait. Nothing.

They look at each other in amazement. One gets a determined look on his face and says, ""Hey...over here in the weeds, there's a railroad tie. Help me carry it over here. When we toss THAT sucker in, it's GOTTA make some noise.""

The two drag the heavy tie over to the hole and heave it in. Not a sound comes from the hole.

Suddenly, out of the nearby woods, a goat appears, running like the wind. It rushes toward the two men, then right past them, running as fast as it's legs will carry it. Suddenly it leaps in the air and into the hole.

The two men are astonished with what they've just seen...

Then, out of the woods comes a farmer who spots the men and ambles over. ""Hey... you two guys seen my goat out here?"" ""You bet we did! Craziest thing I ever saw. It came running like crazy and just jumped into this hole!""

Where I am from, when kids are 'trick or treating' they normally tell a joke in order to get a treat. 

My daughter has a speech delay so can't tell a full joke, she can make all vowel sounds confidently. (There are loads of other words she can say but they aren't as clear so I wouldn't like to put her under pressure with strangers). 

It would make me so happy if I could set up a joke and she gives the punchline...""BOO!''. 

It would mean a lot to her as she could be just as involved as her friends!

Any suggestions would be amazing.

Thanks

He decides on the spot, that he must see them for himself, however it is illegal to travel there. No matter, he has his assistant do some research, and sure enough there is an illegal charter he can take to the island, with a tour guide who promises to bring him to see the Sentinelese for the right price. He lines up the trip, and the next month he and his tour guide make land on North Sentinel Island under the cover of night. The first thing he notices is that off in the distance the sound of drums fills the night air. Intrigued and excited to be one of the few people in the world to have heard such drumming, he asks, ""What are the drums we are hearing? Is it some kind of ceremony?"" The tour guide, looking startled turns around as says, ""Drums good. Drums stop, bad."" and continues into the jungle. They travel inland for miles, the drums getting louder and louder all the time, and finally as the sun is beginning to set - stop to make camp. At this point, the drumming has gone on non-stop for 12 hours and is loud enough that they need to raise their voices to communicate. The businessman, getting annoyed, says to his guide, ""This is getting ridiculous! Do they ever stop that blasted drumming?!"" The tour guide, looks at the businessman with a serious expression and again says, ""Drums good. Drums stop, bad."" The businessman does his best to sleep through the noise, but his head is splitting from a headache and he is barely able to get any rest. They pack up their things in the morning and head off, again deeper into the jungle - the noise from the drumming getting louder and louder with every step. Finally, the businessman can take it no more. He reaches forward and grabs his guide by the shoulder and spins him around. Screaming to be heard over the drums, he asks, ""What is with these god damn drums? Don't tell me 'Drums good. Drums stop, bad.' again! I want to know what happens if the god damn drums stop!""

t3_qlnjz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanjokes/comments/qlnjz4/my_favorite_clean_joke/," A young turtle is seen in the forest climbing up the trunk of a tree. It reaches the first sturdy branch of the tree and climbs out to the very end of it. At the end of the branch it hesitates for a minute before jumping off flailing its legs wildly tumbling end over end before smashing head first into the ground. Slightly dazed the turtle gets up and starts climbing the tree again. This time the turtle passes the first branch, and starts crawling along a higher, less sturdy branch. Once again he reaches the end, hesitates, and then jumps off flailing wildly and end over end until he smashes head first into the ground. This time the turtle seems clearly shaken up, but resolutely starts climbing the tree again. He bypasses both the first and second branch and climbs out the highest, most shaky branch. This time when he reaches the end of the branch he looks over and waves at two birds watching him. The birds look at one another when the male bird says: I think it's time we tell him he is adopted.",My favorite clean joke,2021-11-03 01:23:17-04:00,4

""What I want you to do..."" the man continued. ""Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong.""

So they did.

Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.

And for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.","There was an old man who lived by a forest.
